# Coco/R plug-in for Visual Studio

Install the VSIX form [VS Gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsgallery/ea2a15e2-0ffe-403d-9527-cdf6b45def62).  

This plugin enables the use of Coco/R inside Visual Studio 2015 and 2017.  
It was upgraded from http://www.ssw.jku.at/coco/Tools/VSPlugin/.  
Coco/R is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. The parser uses recursive descent. LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k.  

There are versions of Coco/R for different languages (see below). The latest versions from the University of Linz are those for C#, Java and C++, which can be downloaded from this site. An older (non-reentrant) version of Coco/R for C# and Java can be obtained from here.  

Coco/R is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (slightly extended).
